# rotoHelper

This program is to help with roto-style nba fantasy drafting. It utilizes AI and ML to evaluate total possible space and make the best choices based on your current team and other teams.

rotoDraft.py simulates a draft in real time.

constantDraftSnaker.py runs many simulations and finds the best options based on which draft position you get. Parameters can be altered to search a bigger space or smaller, depending on how long you want it to take.
